# alevin-fry ![Rust](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

Absolutely RADic(a)l methods for analyzing single-cell sequencing data (written in Rust)!

`alevin-fry` is a suite of tools for processing single-cell sequencing data.  It consumes RAD files generated by `alevin`, and performs common operations like generating permit lists, and estimating the number of distinct molecules from each gene within each cell.  The focus in `alevin-fry` is on safety, accuracy and efficiency (in terms of both time and memory usage).

## Installing from bioconda

Alevin-fry is available for both x86 linux and OSX platforms [using bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/alevin-fry).

With `bioconda` in the appropriate place in your channel list, you should simply be able to install via:

```{bash}
$ conda install alevin-fry
``` 

If you want to use features or fixes that may only be available in the latest develop branch (or want to build for a different 
architecture), then you have to build from source.  Luckily, `cargo` makes that easy; see below.

## Building

Alevin-fry is built and tested with the latest (major & minor) stable version of [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/). While it will likely compile fine with slightly older versions of Rust, this is not a guarantee and is not a support priority.  Unlike with C++, Rust has a frequent and stable release cadence, is designed to be installed and updated from user space, and is easy to keep up to date with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/). Thanks to cargo, building should be as easy as:

```{bash}
$ cargo build --release
```

subsequent commands below will assume that the executable is in your path.  Temporarily, this can 
be done (in bash-like shells) using:

```{bash}
$ export PATH=`pwd`/target/release/:$PATH
```

## Documentation 

Alevin-fry is under active development.  However, you can find the documentation on [read the docs](https://alevin-fry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  We try to keep the documentation up to date with the latest developments in the software.  Additionally, there is a series of tutorial for using alevin-fry for processing different types of data that you can find [here](https://combine-lab.github.io/alevin-fry-tutorials/).


## A note about preparing a _splici_ (spliced + intron) refernece

In [the manuscript describing alevin-fry](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.29.450377v1), we primarily make use of an index that is built over spliced + intron sequence, which we refer to as a _splici_ reference.  To make the construction of the relevant reference sequence (and the 3 column TSV file you will need for Unspliced/Spliced/Ambiguous (USA) quantification) simple, we have written an R script that will process a genome and GTF file and produce the splici reference which you can then index with [`salmon`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/salmon) as normal.

First, checkout the [`usefulaf`](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/usefulaf) repository and navigate to the `R` directory.  Then, we'll run the 
`build_splici_ref.R` script.

```
$ ./build_splici_ref.R <path_to_genome_fasta> <path_to_gtf> <target_read_length> <output_dir>
```

where `$` indicated your command prompt. In addition to these required positional arguments, there are a few optional arguments that you can find by running 

```
$ ./build_splici_ref.R -h
```

After you have run this script, your output directory should contain 3 files:

```
<output_dir>/transcriptome_splici_fl<target_read_length-5>.fa
<output_dir>/transcriptome_splici_fl<target_read_length-5>_t2g.tsv
<output_dir>/transcriptome_splici_fl<target_read_length-5>_t2g_3col.tsv
```

The first file contains the _splici_ reference sequence that you should index with `salmon`, and the third contains the 3-column transcript-to-gene mapping 
that you should pass to `alevin-fry` during the `quant` phase.

If you have any questions about preparing the splici reference, or otherwise about processing your data with `alevin-fry` please feel free to open an issue 
here on GitHub!
