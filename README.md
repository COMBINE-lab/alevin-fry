# alevin-fry ![Rust](https://github.com/COMBINE-lab/alevin-fry/workflows/Rust/badge.svg)

Absolutely RADic(a)l methods for analyzing single-cell sequencing data (written in Rust)!

`alevin-fry` is a suite of tools for processing single-cell sequencing data.  It consumes RAD files generated by `alevin`, and performs common operations like generating permit lists, and estimating the number of distinct molecules from each gene within each cell.  The focus in `alevin-fry` is on safety, accuracy and efficiency (in terms of both time and memory usage).

## Installing from bioconda

Alevin-fry is available for both x86 linux and OSX platforms [using bioconda](https://anaconda.org/bioconda/alevin-fry).

With `bioconda` in the appropriate place in your channel list, you should simply be able to install via:

```{bash}
$ conda install alevin-fry
``` 

If you want to use features or fixes that may only be available in the latest develop branch (or want to build for a different 
architecture), then you have to build from source.  Luckily, `cargo` makes that easy; see below.

## Building

Alevin-fry is built and tested with the latest (major & minor version) stable Rust (currently 1.45).
Building should be as easy as:

```{bash}
$ cargo build --release
```

subsequent commands below will assume that the executable is in your path.  Temporarily, this can 
be done (in bash-like shells) using:

```{bash}
$ export PATH=`pwd`/target/release/:$PATH
```

## Documentation 

Alevin-fry is under active development.  However, you can find the documentation on [read the docs](https://alevin-fry.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).  We try to keep the documentation up to date with the latest developments in the software.
